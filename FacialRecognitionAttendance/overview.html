    The aim of this project is to design and implement a classroom attendance recording system
    with a Raspberry Pi computer and camera module. The system utilizes a facial recognition model
    and training images of student faces to detect students as they walk into the classroom. A
    record with the class title, the date of lecture, students present during lecture, and the time
    students arrive class is automatically recorded. The list of students present for lecture is
    compared to a complete roster of the students enrolled in the course is used to create a
    record of students absent from the lecture.
