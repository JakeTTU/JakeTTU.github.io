            This Kyudoku puzzle solver GUI requires Python 3.7 or later.
            The program creates a file based on the user's input and performs a system call to Clingo.
            The output file is named kyuout.lp and is parsed using MKAtoms, and is read back to the GUI.
            This program requires Clingo and MKAtoms to be installed in the user's system path in order to perform the system call.
