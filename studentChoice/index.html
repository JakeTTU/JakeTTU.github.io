        Introduction
    </h1>
        <p class="reportText">
            &emsp;&emsp;The research paper titled “Use of the HoloLens2 Mixed Reality Headset for Protecting Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective, Observational Evaluation” originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research on August 14th 2020 explores the findings of a prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 MR device in telemedicine settings among three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. The three clinical clusters included a COVID-19 general medical ward, a specialist COVID-19 unit providing continuous positive airway pressure support, and a specialist unit providing care to COVID-19 patients with kidney disease. The data obtained included staff exposure time in high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protection equipment used by clinical staff members.
        </p>
        <p class="reportText">
            &emsp;&emsp;The HoloLens2 is a mixed reality headset the includes many types of sensors, infrared time of flight depth measurement, high-definition cameras, accelerometers, and microphones with the ability to place and interact with 2D and 3D objects using the heads up display. In this study the patients’ electronic health record (EHR) data was placed in the field of vision of the clinical staff members using the devices. This provided improved situational awareness resulting in better decision making by the clinical staff as each team member was bidirectionally connected with video and audio to both other clinicians in a safe remote location and the head clinician in the patient’s room offering a first person view of the patient and the patient’s EHR.

        Methodology
    </h1>
        <p class="reportText">
            &emsp;&emsp;Clinical tams were provided with training to understand the basic functions of the HaloLens2 headset. The clinical teams had the freedom to use the technology in the way they deemed optimal for their environment and needs, and therefore not given any specific instruction on how to use the device for their clinical practices. The HoloLens2 device was used with Remote Assist to connect the clinical team and share patient EHR data. To ensure the security of sensitive patient health information, a secure hospital Wi-Fi network was used to connect devices along with a specified list of authorized devices using the devices MAC address and a WPA2 preshared key. Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication were used to protect accounts of the clinicians. Clinician assessments pertaining to feasibility and acceptances were  obtained using questionaries with Likert and free-text responses.

        Results
    </h1>
        <p class="reportText">
            &emsp;&emsp;During this study 52 inpatient beds were included across the three clinical clusters during 51 days of clinical care. Clinical staff members involved in assessing the acceptability and feasibility of using the HoloLens2 device in a telemedicine environment totaled 28 (57.1% male; 64.3% <35 years of age) 20 (71.4%) of whom had no prior experience with the device and 23 (82.1%) fo whom had never used video calling or telemedicine software before the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="reportText">
          &emsp;&emsp;Use of the HoloLens2 device resulted in a significant reduction in clinical staff exposure time in high-risk COVID-19 environments 1.63 vs 3.32 hours/day/clinician totaling 222.98 hours per week of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19 equating to a 51.5% reduction. The reduction in PPE items used by clinical staff members ranged from 100 to 204 per day for each of the three teams representing an approximate saving of 3100 items of PPE used per week across the three clinical clusters. This reduction in PPE usage may have a mitigating effect on supply chain disruption during equipment shortages caused by the global pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="reportText">
           &emsp;&emsp;Deployment of the HoloLens2 device may also further minimize the risk of disease transmission and contamination by interacting with mixed-reality composites of medical devices and medical data through the device instead of physically interacting with devices such as monitors and computers located in high-risk environments.

        Limitations
    </h1>
        <p class="reportText">
          &emsp;&emsp;Although the results found from this study suggests substantial benefits can be obtained through mixed-reality based telemedicine applications, limitations of the study exist. These include the digitally mature environment of the organization the study was performed in, early adopter bias effecting the results, and the deployment in a single organization in a non-blinded, nonrandomized, or noncontrolled fashion has the potential to lead to biased results.
        </p>
        <p class="reportText">
           &emsp;&emsp;Limitations of the device include limited battery life, stability and connection capability over the wireless network, and the ability to interact with individuals whom are not also wearing the device.
        </p>
        <p class="reportText">
          &emsp;&emsp;Concerns about clinicians not being able to directly spend time with patients may come with negative consequences on doctor-patient relationship were raised during this study, but patients themselves recognized the benefits presented by the technology.
        </p>

        Conclusion
    </h1>
        <p class="reportText">
            &emsp;&emsp;The current global pandemic poses many risks to health care workers. In Italy, up to 20% of health care workers have become infected with the virus. This study suggests that the deployment of mixed-reality telemedicine may offer a significant reduction in the chance of virus transmission from COVID-19 positive patients to clinicians. Also by avoiding the necessity of clinicians changing PPE after caring for each patient results in a reduction in the total amount of PPE required which would help mitigate supply chain disruption and PPE shortages globally. The use of mixed-reality telemedicine also provides more information to each clinician giving care for patients, this comes from each clinician having a clear first person view of the patient for a video feed transmitted from the head clinician in patient rooms. Electronic medical record data also provides all clinicians with proper information to aid in decision making with bidirectional voice and video fees promoting teamwork amongst clinical teams.
